# Bomberman Game

Personal re-creation of the classic game [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman). In this game, the single player campaings through a field of enemies and obstacles until it reaches an exit hidden in one of the obstacles. Obstacles an enemies are killed by placing down bombs that explotes in different directions, but that can killed the character as well.

The personal version of this game is based on similar rules, but with different set of figures (all from [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)) and a '[look at all those ckickens!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-X4SLhorvw)' theme because the video is simply brilliant.

### Current Status:

In progress. The bomberman can move through the panel and not through stell walls. It can also set bombs and die if they touch him.
